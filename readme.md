Social Media Content Analyzer

This is an enhanced social media content analyzer built using Streamlit that allows users to upload PDF or image files (including scanned PDFs) to extract text. The text is then analyzed for sentiment, word count, sentence count, and key phrases. Furthermore, it generates actionable suggestions for improving engagement based on the content using the Hugging Face API.

Features:
OCR for Scanned PDFs and Images: Converts scanned PDF pages into images and performs OCR to extract text.
Text Analysis:
Word Count
Sentence Count
Sentiment Analysis (positive, negative, neutral)
Key Phrase Extraction using spaCy
Engagement Suggestions: Uses Hugging Face's GPT-Neo model to provide actionable suggestions for improving social media engagement (e.g., adding calls to action, hashtags).
Requirements
To run this project locally, you'll need to have the following libraries installed:

Streamlit: For the interactive web interface.
Pillow (PIL): For image manipulation and OCR processing.
pytesseract: For Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
spaCy: For advanced text analysis, such as key phrase extraction.
TextBlob: For sentiment analysis.
PyMuPDF (fitz): For reading and processing PDF files.
requests: To make requests to the Hugging Face API.
Installation:
To install the necessary libraries, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install streamlit Pillow pytesseract textblob spacy requests PyMuPDF
Additionally, you may need to install Poppler for PDF rendering on some systems.

For Windows:

Download Poppler from here.
Add the bin folder to your system’s PATH.
For macOS:

bash
Copy
Edit
brew install poppler
For Ubuntu/Debian:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
Poppler Installation (For PDF Processing):
Poppler is required to extract text from scanned PDFs. If you face any issues with PyMuPDF, ensure Poppler is installed on your system.

API Key Configuration
You need to set up your Hugging Face API key to use the engagement suggestion feature:

Get your API key from Hugging Face: Hugging Face API.
Replace the placeholder API key in the code with your actual Hugging Face API key:
python
Copy
Edit
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY = "your_huggingface_api_key"
Usage
Run the Application:

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Upload Files:

You can upload PDF files or images (JPEG/PNG) through the Streamlit interface.
The app will perform OCR (for scanned PDFs) and extract the text.
View Results:

Text Analysis: Includes word count, sentence count, sentiment analysis, and key phrases.
Engagement Suggestions: Generated by Hugging Face's GPT-Neo model.
How It Works
1. Text Extraction from Uploaded Files:
If the uploaded file is a PDF, the app uses PyMuPDF (fitz) to convert each page into an image. Then, it performs OCR using pytesseract to extract text from the images.
If the uploaded file is an image (JPEG or PNG), it directly applies OCR on the image to extract text.
2. Text Analysis:
The extracted text is analyzed using spaCy for key phrase extraction.
TextBlob is used to perform sentiment analysis on the text.
3. Engagement Suggestions:
The extracted text is sent to the Hugging Face API (GPT-Neo model) to generate actionable engagement suggestions, such as adding calls to action or hashtags, to improve the post’s engagement.
Example Output
After uploading a PDF or image, you will see:

Extracted Text: The raw text extracted from the uploaded file.
Text Analysis:
Word count
Sentence count
Sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
Key phrases extracted
Engagement Suggestions: Actionable tips to enhance engagement, such as adding hashtags or a call to action.
Troubleshooting
File Type Not Supported:

Ensure that the uploaded file is either a PDF or an image (JPG/PNG).
If it's a scanned PDF, the app will automatically try to convert it to images for OCR.
Hugging Face API Error:

Ensure your API key is set correctly.
If you encounter server errors (500 errors), try again later as Hugging Face might be experiencing temporary issues.
